Raegan Durdin code changes for CarLot Project
-----------------------------------------------------
- The thing I added to the program was for at the very end, when the user exits out, it launches
the carlot.csv file so the user can see that the neccesarry changes were added correctly
and the information was saved successfully. This is easier then going back into your files and
finding the carlot.csv file to check that everything was correct.
